This repository shows how do perform spatial transcriptomics  RNA analysis (ST; Visium, 10X Genomics) on frozen tissue sections from HCC sample

## Introduction
Spatial transcriptomics is a cutting-edge technology that enables researchers to profile gene expression in the context of tissue architecture. By combining RNA-sequencing with spatial resolution, it provides valuable insights into how gene expression varies across different regions of a tissue, helping to uncover the spatial relationships between cells and their microenvironment.  

10x Genomics offers a platform for spatial transcriptomics known as [Visium Spatial Gene Expression](https://www.10xgenomics.com/spatial-transcriptomics?utm_medium=search&utm_%5B%E2%80%A6%5DAR=&usercampaignid=701VI00000I7ytIYAR&gad_source=1), which integrates high-resolution imaging with transcriptomics.
